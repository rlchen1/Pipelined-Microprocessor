# Pipelined-Microprocessor

5-stage pipelined MIPS microprocessor code repository. Code files are broken into individual compoenents of the design. IF (instruction fetch), ID (instruction decode),
EX (execution), MEM (memory), and WB (write back) are the 5 key stages of the pipelined process. See Lab Report PDF for a more detailed breakdown.
